Undoubtedly. But that is not the point. Before beginning the project, serverless had been a hole in my knowledge.

More generally, this is a theme that is growing in the tech community, and I think for good reason. I like the idea of having a completely modular frontend and backend, being able to swap either out at will, with the other half not caring what it connects to.

Despite there being a few pain-points to navigate (I'm looking at you "defining IAM roles for various steps in the CDK process"), I had a great weekend creating my stack and building a few functions and a database. The final point in this process is deciding how to expose the api endpoints to the frontend. When writing and testing the lambda functions I used function urls (each lambda is given its own url), but I will potentially extend this to use the API gateway for production so I can increase the amount of protection from malicious use and improve the usability of the api (by introducing named endpoints). `,-1))])]),_:1}))}});export{f as default};
